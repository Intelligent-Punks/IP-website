Project rules for Cursor IDE (React + TypeScript, static site, content-separated)

Content and texts:
- All page texts must be stored in src/content/, completely separate from components
- Each page has its own file: home.ts, about.ts, projects.ts, etc.
- Only plain exported objects are allowed – no logic or JSX
- Components should import content directly
- SEO meta (title, description, canonical, openGraph) must be stored in src/content/seo/
- Structured data (JSON-LD) must be stored in src/content/seo/schema.ts
- All images must have alt texts defined in content files

Template page:
- Repeating pages must use a single reusable component (e.g. TemplatePage.tsx)
- Data for repeated blocks (e.g. articles, projects) should be stored as arrays in content

Future-proofing:
- All content must be stored in a way that allows easy migration to API later without changing component structure
- Global constants (social links, emails, phones) must be stored in src/config/

Animations:
- Animations must be handled via helpers in utils/animations.ts or inside AnimatedSection component
- Page transitions must use a single PageTransition wrapper
- No inline animation logic inside JSX

Images & Icons:
- Use WebP/AVIF for photos and backgrounds; fallback to JPEG if necessary
- Use PNG only when transparency or lossless quality is required
- Use SVG for icons, logos, and simple vector graphics
- All images must be optimised and lazy-loaded via utils/images.ts

Performance:
- Lighthouse score must be ≥ 90 across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO
- Heavy sections must use dynamic import/code-splitting
- Avoid inline styles, use TailwindCSS or dedicated style modules
- Routes must be defined in src/routes.ts for consistency

Code generation rules:
- Do not hardcode text in JSX – always load from content
- Components must receive data via props or content imports
- Repeating structures must use map/render functions, avoid duplication

MCP:
- All dependency versions, syntax, and APIs must be validated through MCP context7
- Do not assume versions or behaviour if MCP context is disconnected
- If MCP context is unavailable, explicitly notify before generating code
